# Product Catalogue

Brodos Products catalog that allows users to search for products by keywords and displays the filtered results on the webpage using JavaScript and a JSON file. The HTML file contains the structure of the page, the JavaScript file contains the functionality, and the JSON file contains the data for the products.

The HTML file contains the layout of the page, including a form for users to enter keywords and a container for the featured products. The JavaScript file contains the functionality for fetching the data from the JSON file, filtering the data based on user input, and generating the elements for the products. The JSON file contains the data for the products, including their names, images, descriptions, and prices.

Overall, it appears that the project is well-organized and structured, with clear separation of concerns between the HTML, JavaScript, and JSON files. The JavaScript code uses modern syntax and follows best practices, such as using const and let instead of var, and using arrow functions and template literals. The HTML code uses the Tailwind CSS framework to style the page, which can save time and improve consistency in design. The JSON data is well-formatted and organized, with each product having its own object with relevant properties.

One potential improvement could be to add error handling for the fetch requests, in case the JSON data or images fail to load. Another improvement could be to add sorting functionality to allow users to sort the products by name, price, or other criteria.
